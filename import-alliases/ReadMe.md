# Import Aliases


Module aliases in JavaScript are essentially alternate names or shortcuts used to reference modules within a project. They're often employed to simplify the import paths of modules, especially when dealing with long, complex, or nested folder structures.

e.g

in a project with multiple nested folders, importing modules can become cumbersome due to the deep file structure. Module aliases provide a way to create shorter, more readable import paths.
